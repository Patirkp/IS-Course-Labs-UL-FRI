    "### Task 1: Entity Recognition and Replacement\n",
    "- **Objective:** Recognize named entities in imdb dataset (such as person names, locations) and replace them with generic labels to anonymize text data, if necessary.\n",
    "- **Instructions:**\n",
    "  - Utilize Stanza's entity recognition capabilities to identify named entities within the text.\n",
    "  - Replace recognized named entities with generic labels or placeholders to ensure anonymity in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Removal of HTML Tags or URLs\n",
    "- **Objective:** Enhance the preprocess function to eliminate HTML tags and URLs from the text data in imdb dataset.\n",
    "- **Instructions:**\n",
    "  - Update the preprocess function using regular expressions to remove HTML tags (e.g., <tag>) and URLs present within the text.\n",
    "  - Ensure the removal of HTML tags and URLs to clean the text data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: Comparison of Pre-trained Word Embeddings\n",
    "- **Objective:** Download various pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., FastText, Word2Vec, GloVe) and evaluate their performance against custom-trained embeddings on imdb dataset.\n",
    "- **Instructions:**\n",
    "  - Access the NLPL Vector Repository http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/ to download pre-trained word embeddings such as FastText, Word2Vec, and GloVe.\n",
    "  - Compare these pre-trained embeddings with our custom-trained embeddings on imdb dataset."
